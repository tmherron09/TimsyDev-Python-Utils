timsy_mvc_template
------------------

This package contains template (boilerplate) classes for the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern using Tkinter.

The files in this package are not meant to be used directly in your application. Instead, they serve as starting points for your own concrete implementations:
- `controller.py`: Template for a Controller class. Add your event handling and coordination logic here.
- `model.py`: Template for a Model class. Add your data fields, business logic, and event system here.
- `view.py`: Template for a View class. Add your UI layout and widget logic here.
- `main.py`: Template for the main entry point of a Tkinter MVC app. Instantiate your Model, View, and Controller here.

To use these templates, copy and modify them to fit your application's needs. See the docstrings in each file for more details and guidance.
